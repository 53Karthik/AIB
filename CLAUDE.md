# CLAUDE.md — AIB Life SLA Governance

SLA governance prototype: source extracts go in; they are classified from content, scored
against contracted SLAs, and published as one governance pack per reporting month. The
Phase 2 intelligence layer (trends, breach risk, recurring causes, narrative, Q&A) runs on
that history. Full product description: [README.md](README.md).

**Current initiative:** refresh the client demo video with current features, the existing report data and native Windows cursor artwork.
The plan, the analysis and the iteration history all live in **[DEV_LOG.md](DEV_LOG.md)**.
Read it before starting work.

## Iteration logging protocol (MANDATORY)

The user requires a written trail of every change and every error. At the **end of every
iteration**, meaning any turn that changes code, config or data, or that hits an error, do
all four steps before the final reply:

1. **Append an entry** to the *Iteration log* in [DEV_LOG.md](DEV_LOG.md), using the format
   of the existing entries:
   - iteration number, date (absolute, `YYYY-MM-DD`) and goal
   - **Changes:** each file touched and what changed in it
   - **Errors faced:** a table with columns # · symptom · root cause · fix. An error is
     anything that failed: a command, a test, an oracle diff, a wrong assumption or a
     reverted approach. Write "None" only when that is literally true.
   - **Verification:** the commands actually run and their actual result. Report failures
     as failures.
   - **Next:** the concrete next step.
2. **Update the plan** in DEV_LOG.md §3:
   - tick or flag status boxes (`[ ]` `[~]` `[x]` `[-]`)
   - add newly discovered tasks
   - when the plan changes, say why in the iteration entry
3. **Update this file:** refresh *Current status* below, and add any newly learned trap to
   *Known pitfalls* so no later session repeats it.
4. Mention in the final reply that DEV_LOG.md and CLAUDE.md were updated.

Keep entries factual and short. Never rewrite earlier entries. If one turns out to be wrong,
add a correction in the new entry.

## Current status

_Last updated: 2026-10-01 · Iteration 9_

- **Amazon Nova connected:** local `.env` configures `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` in
  `us-east-1`. AWS identity and live invocation were verified; the app was restarted and
  fresh report narrative and Q&A responses returned `source: bedrock`. Do not copy local
  credentials into docs, code, browser assets or Git. The user was advised to rotate the
  key shared in the conversation and update the local configuration.
- `npm run bedrock:check` now tests the configured model through the app's adapter,
  rather than probing Anthropic-only candidates. Narrative cache identity includes
  provider, model and region as well as report facts; credential values are excluded.

- **Governance pack access:** the report was never removed. A visible dashboard shortcut
  now opens the latest complete month's pack (or the newest period if none is complete).
  SLA Status and Exceptions also have a visible Governance pack button for their selected
  month. Reports still lists it. Export as PDF opens the browser print window; choose
  Save as PDF to download the report. The five report sections and calculations are unchanged.

- **Customer terminology:** Data Sources, SLA Status, Policies and Reports now appear
  throughout the working UI, findings, Intelligence answers and print packs. Vendor wording
  is removed from presentation, including cached narrative text. Schedule 23 codes remain
  unchanged at the user's explicit request. Policies are counted per service record.
  Public hash routes use `#data-sources` and `#YYYY-MM/status`; old links remain supported.
- **Deferred chatbot request:** the user wants LLM reasoning grounded in findings and report
  evidence, with scope limits and supported predictions, instead of unrelated canned answers.
  They explicitly postponed this work. AWS/Nova connectivity is now complete; fuller
  context, reasoning, validation and supported predictions remain deferred. Existing
  report-only prompts, numeric guards, rules fallback and single-turn Q&A are unchanged.

- **Updated client demo video:** production artifacts are in `deliverables/client-demo-v2/`.
  The refreshed 3:57 walkthrough uses current Data Sources/SLA Status/Policies/Reports copy,
  actual Nova Pro narrative and Q&A, visible Governance pack shortcuts, and PDF export.
  All five current files and all 22 months of results matched the isolated capture copy.
  Windows arrow/hand cursor resources replace the old polygon. Narration is generated
  offline with Microsoft Zira Desktop; the external voice-service call was blocked by
  automatic approval review and no narration was sent to it in this iteration.
  Final verification passed: 1080p/24fps, 48.9 MiB, 82 captions without overlaps, six working
  chapter links and zero decode/browser errors. The original `deliverables/client-demo/` is retained.
  Reproduction scripts are under `scripts/demo/`; intermediate work is `.demo-work/v2/`.

- **Local application guide:** `public/application-guide.html` provides interactive architecture,
  data flow, three user journeys, feature explanations and source references. A printable copy
  is in `public/application-guide.pdf`; both are linked from README. The guide reflects the
  current code, including Q&A's figure-only guard and the non-versioned filesystem store.
  Both guide formats were refreshed with Iteration 7's customer terminology.

- **Direction:** all demo logic is discarded. Everything follows `Claude_Data/` only. The UI
  keeps its visual design. Decisions D1–D7 are in DEV_LOG.md §3.
- **Branch:** the current working branch is **`Karthik`**, at `ba7fa6f`, also
  referenced by `omkar/Ommkar`. Local `main` and `backup-karthik` are at
  `fcb17ec`, before the BaNCS integration. **Never commit to `main`.**
- **Done (plan phases A–E complete):**
  - The engine reproduces `SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx` exactly (0 diffs, csv and xlsx).
  - The backend builds 22 monthly packs from the extract set, auto-loaded on a cold start.
  - Every screen runs on the real data with the original design: Dashboard, Data Sources, SLA
    Status, Exceptions, Governance pack, and Intelligence (including the guarded Bedrock
    narrative and Q&A).
  - README rewritten. `npm test` passes 24/24.
- **Presenter's briefing** (Iteration 4, private):
  https://claude.ai/artifact/PrWoChV2v16Ez4eKeemUr2. It covers architecture, data flow,
  proof, demo script and Q&A. Republish from the same conversation, or pass that URL, to
  update it.
- **Open:**
  - user review; merging or opening a PR is the user's decision
  - before real extracts: DEV_LOG.md Phase F. F1 is a header-less EBQ reader, F2 is to
    extend the holiday calendar past 2026-08-03.

## Project rules

- **Classification uses content only.** Filenames are never inspected. This holds for the
  real extracts too: derive the source type and the extract (as-of) date from content.
- **No model-generated numbers or claims.** Every SLA figure comes from deterministic code. The
  narrative and assistant only phrase pre-computed figures. Two guards enforce this:
  `unsupportedFigures` (every number must be in the input) and `contradictedClaims` (no
  inverted pass/fail).
- **No invented logic.** Rules, targets, holidays and mapping come from the workbook. No
  forecasts, amber bands or service credits, because the data defines none of them.
- **One current pack per month.** The packs are derived from the whole extract set, and a
  rebuild replaces all of them. One current file per slot: a new upload for a filled slot
  supersedes the old one.
- **The oracle is the definition of done.** Engine work on the real data is complete only
  when `Claude_Data/SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx` reproduces with zero diffs.
- Match the surrounding code style: ES modules, small pure functions, explanatory block
  comments where a rule is non-obvious.

## Known pitfalls

Add to this list whenever something bites.

**Real BaNCS data**
- `data/` is ignored by Git: a hard reset does not restore deleted imported
  extracts or rebuild packs. `npm run data:load` restores the original dataset
  from committed `Claude_Data/`; stop the app before running it.
- Moving the snapshot into October makes September non-partial, but pending
  ages alone do not supply missing September activity. Use a consistent later
  snapshot across all five slots and retain history because uploads replace
  slots. Keep generated extensions separate from the original oracle dataset.
- Date cells in the `.xlsx` extracts are Excel date-times. `parse.js` `cellText()`
  currently truncates them to `YYYY-MM-DD`, which **drops the time** needed for the 3pm and
  48h rules. In the `.csv` files they are `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss` strings.
- Treat all timestamps as **UTC wall-clock** (Irish local time, never converted). Never use
  local-time `Date` methods.
- The extracts are **multi-month snapshots** (2024-12 → 2026-09), not monthly files.
  `detectMonth` / `month_mismatch` logic does not apply to them.
- The two `WRKFLWEXT` files have identical columns. Tell them apart by content
  (Status `In Progress` + `Pending Since Days` vs Status `Closed` + `Close Date`).
- The 23B mapping has these quirks:
  - lowercase code `Ul`
  - a trailing space in a transaction name
  - duplicate rows
  - the spelling `Infletion`

  The mapping joins on Transaction (col B) + Product.
- `Request ID` has lost 2 digits of precision, so it is not a join key. WITHDRAWALEXT
  contains the literal string `nan`.
- The 23E workflow type must *start with* `Manual Review` (the real values carry
  suffixes). The phrase match ignores case, and `Recognized` decoys must not match.
- Open items are OPEN - PAST DEADLINE only when the deadline day is **before** the extract
  date. An item whose deadline is the extract date is NOT YET DUE.
- The extract date comes from content: open workflow Created Date + Pending Since Days
  = 2026-09-24.
- The workbook's `Monthly summary` is COUNTIFS formulas. **ExcelJS drops cached results that
  are falsy** (`0` or `""`), so a formula cell with no `result` means 0 or blank.
- Merged cells: ExcelJS repeats the master value on every cell of a merge, so take the
  first occurrence.
- ExcelJS `row.values` is truncated after the last filled cell. Read cells by index with
  `row.getCell(n)`.

**Project rules for git**
- The user does **not** want changes on `main`. Commit on the current feature branch
  (`Karthik` as of 2026-10-01). Run `git branch --show-current` before every commit, and never switch
  branches without being asked.

- A pass/fail figure can be real and still stated backwards. The Bedrock narrative once said
  23C failed at 96.97% (target 96%). Keep met/missed as explicit lists in any model brief.
- Drivers: a big group failing at about the average rate is not a concentration. Require
  at least 1.25× the SLA rate, and rank by excess failures.
- Each extract ships as both .csv and .xlsx. Never load both, or every record counts twice.
  The slot model enforces this.

- Identify extracts from the **first worksheet only**. The expected-results workbook's
  '23B UL Step 2' tab carries every WITHDRAWALEXT column, and it once replaced the real
  extract. It is now rejected explicitly.
- Charts: a month with one or two completed items can sit at 0%. Clip such values at the
  axis with a label rather than letting them set the scale.
- **The real EBQ report has no header row.** The synthetic copy in `Claude_Data/` has one
  added (see the workbook README). Header-based identification will reject the real file.
  This is Phase F1.
- The holiday calendar is exactly the workbook's list and ends 2026-08-03. Extend it
  before loading later extracts (Phase F2).
- Verification scale, for quoting: 14,898 rows per format (six tabs) plus 176
  month-by-SLA results. It is not 16,898.

**UI conventions**

- Model connectivity is separate from the chatbot redesign: successful Nova calls do not
  add forecasting or multi-turn reasoning. Keep the active scope clear to the user.
- Cache identity must include the provider/model/region. A report-only cache hash can keep
  serving a rules summary after credentials are added. Never include credential values in
  cache keys, logs or tracked files. Restart the server after changing `.env`.
- Keep Governance pack visibly accessible: hiding it only inside a per-period menu made
  the user think the feature had been removed. Export is the browser's PDF workflow;
  explain the Save as PDF step beside the button.
- Customer copy is adapted in `src/lib/customerCopy.js` at the frontend API boundary.
  Keep legacy storage paths, IDs, filenames, outcome values and numeric evidence intact;
  do not rewrite raw files or rebuild packs for wording changes. Saved findings and cached
  narratives can contain old wording, so updating JSX alone is insufficient.
- "Policies" counts service records, not distinct policy numbers. Keep the count note.
- A live user can replace imports during verification. Save a per-run data baseline and
  distinguish changed source metadata from changed computed results; never restore old
  imports over their changes. Iteration 7 saw a concurrent import change to mixed CSV/XLSX.
- Documentation accuracy: `askAssistant()` applies `unsupportedFigures()` only; it does not
  call `contradictedClaims()`. The executive narrative applies both. Do not describe Q&A as
  having the narrative's claim checker until that checker is explicitly integrated.
- Reuse the design system's classes and tokens (`card`, `stat`, `table`, `rag-*`,
  `scope-chip`, `cluster-row`, ...). Add CSS only in the small "SLA table and item lists"
  block.
- Check layout with headless Edge screenshots at 1440 px:
  `msedge --headless=new --window-size=1440,1800 --virtual-time-budget=9000 --screenshot=out.png http://localhost:5174/#2026-08/position`

**Demo production**
- The current capture defaults to `.demo-work/v2/` and new run-specific data directories.
  `capture.mjs --finish` reuses the recorded dataset and recaptures only the final report
  screens. Never mutate the live `data/` imports for a recording.
- Native CUR files need their alpha mask and hotspot preserved. Pillow's CUR reader returns
  opaque RGB; `native_cursor.py` wraps the unchanged DIB entry as ICO for RGBA decoding.
- Scroll controls into view before CDP clicks. Wait for the Intelligence closing animation
  (800ms), not just removal of `is-open`, before capturing the report underneath.
- Windows System.Speech may enumerate voices inside the sandbox but fail to select one.
  The approved local process can synthesize WAV/word timing files; `voice.py --reuse-wav`
  packages those locally without accessing the voice engine again. No external TTS is needed.
- Use explicit 16 kHz PCM for Windows narration. Default 22.05 kHz output produced
  word event times beyond the WAV duration. Validate word and caption intervals before
  encoding; do not merely clamp malformed subtitles.
- If the approved speech process cannot discover bundled FFmpeg, run only `voice-local.ps1`
  there and package with `voice.py --reuse-wav` locally.
- Keep Vite watching exclusions broad enough for every `deliverables/` version.

**Environment (Windows)**

- Browser capture profiles must be outside the Vite project root (use the OS temp directory).
  Watching Edge's transient locked profile files can crash Vite with EBUSY. The isolated
  recording server also ignores `.demo-work/`, `.demo-tools/` and `deliverables/`.
- Stop the server before `npm run data:load` / `reset`, because open handles block deletes.
- Tracked text files have **CRLF** line endings in the working copy (autocrlf). A
  `
`-anchored regex edit silently matches nothing, so use the Edit tool or normalise first.
- Do not pass regex-bearing code through bash heredocs into JS template strings, because
  the escapes get mangled. Use the Edit tool.
- Python prints to a cp1252 console, so set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` when printing
  workbook text.
- Artifact publishing: use the long temp path `C:\Users\OmmkarBisoi\AppData\Local\Temp\…`.
  The 8.3 short form `OMMKAR~1` is blocked by the Read permission rule for supporting
  files.
- Headless Edge renders pages in the dark theme by default. Check both themes when it
  matters.
- There is no pandas or openpyxl. Use `exceljs` via Node (`npm install` has now been run).
- Node 24: `node --test <dir>` fails with MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Pass a glob:
  `node --test "server/**/*.test.js"`.
- The Grep tool (ripgrep) rejects nested brace globs.
