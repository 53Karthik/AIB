# Development Log — Real BaNCS Data Integration

The running record of this initiative: the **active plan** (with live status), and an
**iteration log** of every change made and every error hit along the way.

Maintained under the protocol in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#iteration-logging-protocol-mandatory) —
updated at the end of every iteration, never retro-written.

---

## 1. Goal

Replace the synthetic 15-metric demo data with the real-format TCS BaNCS extracts in
[`Claude_Data/`](Claude_Data/), scoring them against the contracted Schedule 23 SLAs, so the
dashboard, governance pack, exceptions view and Phase 2 intelligence all run on that data.

**Acceptance oracle:** [`Claude_Data/SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx`](Claude_Data/SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx)
gives the expected outcome for every row and every month. The engine is done when it
reproduces it with **zero differences**, row-level and monthly.

---

## 2. What the data is (analysis, Iteration 0)

> The workbook's README tab says the extracts are **synthetic test data in the real extract
> format**: names, policies, user IDs and request IDs are fictitious. Extract date 24/09/2026,
> activity 01/01/2025 – 23/09/2026.

### 2.1 Files

`SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx` and `SLA_Expected_Results(2).xlsx` are byte-identical. Every
extract ships as both `.csv` and `.xlsx`.

| File | Rows | Layout | Feeds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EBQ_Correspondence_Report_V0_24092026` | 10,000 | Header on row 1, no title row | 23B NUL, 23B UL Step 1 |
| `CANREVEXT_…1781224092026` (Cancellation Tracker) | 2,000 | Title row 1, header row 2 | 23C |
| `WITHDRAWALEXT_…1781524092026` (Withdrawal extract) | 514 | Title row 1, header row 2 | 23B UL Step 2 |
| `WRKFLWEXT_…1781324092026` (Workflow, **open**) | 231 | Title row 1, header row 2, Status = In Progress | 23A, 23B UL 2–3, 23C, 23E |
| `WRKFLWEXT_…1781424092026` (Workflow, **closed**) | 5,124 | Same 16 columns, Status = Closed | 23A, 23B UL 2–3, 23C, 23E |
| `SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx` | 10 tabs | README, Monthly summary, Mapping for 23B, per-SLA tabs, Links | Oracle and 23B mapping |

### 2.2 The SLAs (entirely different from the current 15 metrics)

| SLA | Target | Population | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **23A** | 97% | Workflows `Issue Policy Immediately` / `Issue Policy at a Later Date` | Created before 15:00: closed the same business day. 15:00 or later: same or next business day. |
| **23B NUL** | 96% | EBQ rows whose Product + Transaction maps to `NUL` | Merged by the end of the next business day after receipt |
| **23B UL Step 1** | 98% | EBQ rows mapped `UL` | Merged the same business day (no time in EBQ, so no 3pm cut-off) |
| **23B UL Step 2** | 98% | WITHDRAWALEXT matched to `Workflow for Withdrawal Approval` on the same policy | Created Date vs last-status time, using the 3pm rule |
| **23B UL Step 3** | 98% | `Workflow for Unit Adjustment` | Created vs Close, using the 3pm rule |
| **23B UL overall** | 98% | Steps 1–3 combined | Met ÷ completed |
| **23C** | 96% | CANREVEXT for 360 Protect, Business, Income and Mortgage Protection, matched to `Approve Cancellation` | Under 48 hours from workflow Created to last status |
| **23E** | 98% | Workflow type starting `Manual Review`, description contains "EFT Payment Not Recognised" (case-insensitive) | Closed the same or next business day |

Shared rules:
- A clock that starts on a weekend or holiday starts on the next business day, counted as
  before 15:00.
- Irish public holidays are listed in the oracle README.
- REJECTED EBQ items are excluded.
- Open items are classed as `OPEN - PAST DEADLINE` or `OPEN - NOT YET DUE` against the extract date.
- Rate (Completed) = Met ÷ (Met + Missed), and **PASS/FAIL is judged on this rate**.
- Rate (incl. Open) also counts open-past-deadline items as not met.
- Reporting month:
  - EBQ items use the receipt (Start) month.
  - Workflow SLAs use the workflow Created month.
  - Withdrawals with no workflow use the last-status month.

### 2.3 Oracle totals (what the engine must reproduce)

| SLA | Met | Missed | Open past deadline | Rate (Completed) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 23A | 1145 | 32 | 29 | 97.28% PASS |
| 23B NUL | 4575 | 190 | 855 | 96.01% PASS |
| 23B UL Step 1 | 1962 | 52 | 418 | 97.42% |
| 23B UL Step 2 | 442 | 12 | 49 | 97.36% |
| 23B UL Step 3 | 371 | 9 | 20 | 97.63% |
| 23B UL overall | 2775 | 73 | 487 | 97.44% FAIL |
| 23C | 1437 | 66 | 0 | 95.61% FAIL |
| 23E | 549 | 13 | 28 | 97.69% FAIL |

Monthly figures cover **22 months, 2024-12 → 2026-09**. Dec-2024 has a single 23C item.
Sep-2026 is a partial month.

Row-level outcome categories:
- `MET`, `MISSED`
- `OPEN - PAST DEADLINE`, `OPEN - NOT YET DUE`
- `OUT OF SCOPE`, `EXCLUDED - REJECTED`
- `NO MATCHING WORKFLOW` (Step 2)

### 2.4 Traps the oracle plants on purpose

- **Mapping:**
  - duplicate rows
  - code `Ul` (lowercase) instead of `UL`
  - a trailing space (`Change Income Recipient Bank Account Details `)
  - the misspelling `Infletion`
  - The mapping joins on **Transaction (col B) + Product**, not on col C.
- **3pm boundary:** 14:59:xx vs exactly 15:00:00, closed next business day (missed vs met).
- **23C:**
  - 47h59m30s vs exactly 48h00m00s
  - the 48h reading vs calendar-date and 2-working-day readings (alternates shown in the tab)
  - policies with an earlier, withdrawn approval workflow: use the **latest one created before** the last-status time
- **23E:**
  - description casing varies
  - 15 decoys spelled `Recognized`
  - 10 decoys that are Unit Adjustment workflows
  - 15 created by the system on a Saturday
- **Step 2:**
  - 10 withdrawals with no workflow
  - 10 approval workflows with no withdrawal
  - 14 policies with two withdrawals
  - 50 `Awaiting Authorization`, which are not completions
- **Request ID** has lost its last two digits (Excel 15-digit limit). Never use it as a join key.
- WITHDRAWALEXT carries the literal string `nan` in `Approver Role already approved`.

### 2.5 Where the current code does not fit

> **Superseded (Iteration 1):** the demo code this table analyses is being removed rather than adapted — see §3. Kept for history.

| # | Gap | Where |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | **Metric model:** 15 synthetic value-vs-target metrics. The real SLAs are met/missed *rates* with open-item backlog. | [config/sla-metrics.json](config/sla-metrics.json), [server/slaEngine.js](server/slaEngine.js) |
| G2 | **Source model:** 5 synthetic source fingerprints (BaNCS, AWS Connect, Azure, tracker, email). The real set is 5 BaNCS extract types, and two of them (open/closed workflow) share identical columns. | [config/source-templates.json](config/source-templates.json), [server/classify.js](server/classify.js) |
| G3 | **Time lost on xlsx:** `cellText()` turns Date cells into `YYYY-MM-DD`, dropping time-of-day. That kills the 3pm and 48h rules. | [server/parse.js:28](server/parse.js#L28) |
| G4 | **No date-time parsing:** `toDate()` reads `dd/mm/yyyy` but drops the time, and has no Excel-serial or `nan` handling. | [server/adapters/util.js:43](server/adapters/util.js#L43) |
| G5 | **No business calendar:** nothing knows about weekends, Irish holidays, the 3pm cut-off, or next-business-day deadlines. | new |
| G6 | **Per-file adapters:** each adapter sees one file. 23B UL Step 2 and 23C need **cross-file joins** (withdrawal ↔ workflow, cancellation ↔ workflow), and the open/closed workflow files must be unioned. | [server/pipeline.js](server/pipeline.js), [server/adapters/](server/adapters/) |
| G7 | **One upload per month:** the pipeline assumes one upload per month. The real extracts are a **single multi-month snapshot** that must fan out into 22 monthly packs. `detectMonth` would also mis-flag every file as `month_mismatch`. | [server/pipeline.js](server/pipeline.js), [server/dataQuality.js](server/dataQuality.js) |
| G8 | **Classifier assumes distinct sources:** `classifyBatch` assumes at most one file per template. Two WRKFLWEXT files need a content discriminator (Status / Close Date / Pending Since Days). | [server/classify.js:105](server/classify.js#L105) |
| G9 | **Hard-coded assumptions:** the UI hard-codes "of 5 sources" and the five source badges. The assistant aliases, narrative and demand panel assume calls, complaints and escalations. | [src/views/Ingest.jsx:118](src/views/Ingest.jsx#L118), [src/views/Dashboard.jsx:77](src/views/Dashboard.jsx#L77), [src/lib/sources.js](src/lib/sources.js), [server/assistant.js:35](server/assistant.js#L35), [server/narrative.js](server/narrative.js), [server/intelligence.js:305](server/intelligence.js#L305) |
| G10 | **Rail sized for ~6 months:** the left rail was just rebuilt to never scroll. 22 months will not fit as-is. | [src/components/Rail.jsx](src/components/Rail.jsx) |

The following survive unchanged:
- RAG engine shape
- Store layout (one current pack per month)
- Breakdown and clustering machinery
- The fabrication guard

---

## 3. Active plan

Status key: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` dropped (with reason)

> **Revised 2026-09-24 (Iteration 1).** The user directed: *forget every piece of logic in the
> previous version — it was a demo built on made-up rules. Follow only the data in
> `Claude_Data/`. Keep the UI design.* The original eight-phase plan, which adapted the demo
> pipeline, is superseded. The backend is being rebuilt from the data, and the UI keeps its
> visual design with its content rewritten.

### Decisions (confirmed by the user)

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Synthetic demo | **Removed entirely.** No demo profile. The old metrics, sources, adapters, classifier, seed data and generators all go. |
| D2 | Amber / RAG | **None.** The workbook defines only PASS/FAIL, judged on Rate (Completed). The UI shows PASS, FAIL or "no completed items". |
| D3 | Service credits | **Dropped.** The data does not define them. |
| D4 | Ambiguous readings | Follow the workbook's stated defaults (README "Defaults" 1–10). |
| D5 | `Claude_Data/` in git | **Commit it**, on the feature branch `feature/real-bancs-data`. **Never commit to `main`.** |
| D6 | Intelligence panel | **Data insights plus an AI summary.** Trends and miss drivers are computed from the data. The Bedrock narrative and Q&A may only phrase those computed figures, and the fabrication guard is kept. **No forecasts.** |
| D7 | Getting data in | **Upload screen plus auto-load.** Drop the extract set once and every monthly pack is built. On a cold start, `Claude_Data/` is loaded automatically. |

### Phase A — SLA engine from the data (Iteration 1)
- [x] A1 `config/sla-schedule.json`: the 8 SLA lines (23A, 23B NUL, 23B UL plus Steps 1–3, 23C, 23E), targets, 3 pm cut-off and Irish holidays, all copied from the workbook.
- [x] A2 `scripts/extract-mapping.js` → `config/mapping-23b.json`: a verbatim copy of *Mapping for 23B*, 83 rows with the quirks preserved.
- [x] A3 `server/engine/datetime.js`: timestamps as UTC wall-clock. Handles Date cells, Excel serials, `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss`, ISO and `nan`.
- [x] A4 `server/engine/calendar.js`: business days, clock start, same-day / next-day / 3 pm-rule deadlines.
- [x] A5 `server/engine/extracts.js`: reads csv/xlsx and identifies the extract type from its column headers. Keeps the spreadsheet row numbers.
- [x] A6 `server/engine/workflows.js`: unions the open and closed WRKFLWEXT files, does the "latest workflow created before the event" join, and derives the extract date from Created + Pending Since Days.
- [x] A7 `server/engine/rules.js`: 23A, 23B NUL / UL Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, 23C, 23E, each returning item-level outcomes.
- [x] A8 `server/engine/engine.js`: `evaluate()` produces items plus the monthly roll-up (Rate Completed, Rate incl. Open, PASS/FAIL).
- [x] A9 `scripts/verify-real.js` + `npm run verify:real`: **0 diffs** against every SLA tab and the Monthly summary, for both the csv and xlsx sets.
- [x] A10 `server/engine/calendar.test.js` + `npm test`: 8 boundary tests.

### Phase B — Backend swap (Iteration 2) — done
- [x] B1 Store layout:
  - `data/extracts/`: the current extract set, with an index
  - `data/analyses/<month>.json`: one pack per month
  - `data/snapshot.json`: as-of date, sources and totals
- [x] B2 Pipeline:
  - `importExtracts(files)`: read, identify and store the files (a same-kind file replaces the old one, except workflow, which allows open + closed)
  - `rebuild()`: evaluate and write every month's pack
- [x] B3 Data-quality findings, derived only from the data:
  - open items past deadline (backlog)
  - withdrawals with no approval workflow, and approval workflows with no withdrawal
  - REJECTED EBQ exclusions
  - EBQ pairs not in the 23B mapping
  - mapping quirks normalised
  - policies with more than one candidate workflow
  - partial final month
  - Request-ID precision loss
  - `nan` literals
- [x] B4 API:
  - `bootstrap`
  - `extracts` (list / upload / delete / rebuild)
  - `analysis/:month`
  - `items/:month` (filterable)
  - `intelligence`
  - `ask`
- [x] B5 Cold start: when no packs exist, import `Claude_Data/` automatically. `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_DATA=1` disables this.
- [x] B6 Delete the demo code:
  - `server/adapters/`, `classify.js`, `parse.js`, `slaEngine.js`, `dataQuality.js`, `prepareDemo.js`
  - `config/sla-metrics.json`, `config/source-templates.json`
  - `scripts/seed.js`, `scenario.js`, `generators/`, `lib/`, `prepare-demo.js`
  - `data/seed/`, `data/holdback/`
  - the matching npm scripts

### Phase C — UI on the real data (Iteration 3), keeping the visual design — done
- [x] C0 Remove the old per-month ingest flow (confirm/correct classification, samples, held-back file) from the UI
- [x] C1 Routing:
  - a global **Extracts** screen, reached from the dashboard hero and the rail
  - per-month views: SLA position, Exceptions, Governance pack
- [x] C2 Dashboard:
  - hero copy
  - stats: periods, rows processed, SLA fails, overdue open items
  - period cards: PASS/FAIL of the 5 headline SLAs, with a partial-month tag
- [x] C3 Rail: period cards show fails. Foot shows the extract as-of date.
- [x] C4 Extracts screen:
  - drop zone
  - checklist of the 4 extract kinds (workflow expects open + closed)
  - file rows showing kind, records, header row and the SLAs fed
  - rebuild button
- [x] C5 SLA position table, per SLA:
  - target
  - met / missed / open overdue / open not yet due
  - Rate (Completed), Rate (incl. Open)
  - gap to target
  - PASS/FAIL

  The 23B UL steps are nested. The data-quality panel sits below.
- [x] C6 Exceptions: failing SLAs, plus an item-level table of missed and overdue items, filterable by SLA.
- [x] C7 Governance pack (print/PDF):
  - executive summary composed from the figures
  - SLA table
  - exceptions
  - data quality
  - evidence (extract files)

### Phase D — Intelligence on the real data (D1–D2 done in Iteration 2; D3 UI in Iteration 3)
- [x] D1 `server/intelligence.js` rewritten, with no forecasts:
  - per-SLA monthly trend (both rates vs target)
  - months passed and failed
  - latest full month vs partial month
  - where misses concentrate (assignee, product, workflow / transaction type)
  - backlog by SLA
- [x] D2 Narrative and Q&A rewritten to phrase only those figures. Keep the Bedrock client, the disk cache, the rules fallback and the fabrication guard.
- [x] D3 Panel UI: trend chart (target line, fail region), SLA record, drivers, backlog, narrative and ask box.

### Phase E — Finish (done in Iteration 3)
- [x] E1 README rewritten for the real data.
- [x] E2 `npm run build`, then a browser walk-through of the dashboard, extracts, month views, pack PDF and intelligence.
- [x] E3 `npm run verify:real` and `npm test` still green.

### Phase F - September/October data extension (2026-10-01)
- [x] F1 Check the original source files, current runtime snapshot, and available Git baselines; document restoration without resetting the branch.
- [ ] F2 Resolve whether the extension uses generated demo records or newer supplied extracts.
- [ ] F3 Build/import a consistent later snapshot; verify September complete and October present but incomplete when observed in October.

### Phase G - End-to-end governance explanation (2026-10-05)
- [x] G1 Trace upload, content classification, slot replacement, parsing, normalisation, rule evaluation, monthly roll-up and persistence against the implementation.
- [x] G2 Explain every JSON boundary and distinguish multipart upload, in-memory JavaScript objects, JSON configuration, JSON persistence and JSON API transport.
- [x] G3 Map Dashboard, Extracts, SLA position, Exceptions, Governance pack and Intelligence to their APIs and backend producers.
- [x] G4 Add a worked 23B UL Step 2 record and a code/function index in `docs/end-to-end-governance-flow.md`.

## 4. Iteration log

Newest entry at the bottom. Each entry: goal · changes · errors (symptom → cause → fix) ·
verification · next.

### Iteration 0 — 2026-09-24 · Analysis and planning

**Goal:** understand the codebase and `Claude_Data/`, and produce an integration plan and tracking files.

**Changes**
- Added `DEV_LOG.md` (this file): analysis, plan, iteration log.
- Added `CLAUDE.md`: project guide and the mandatory iteration-logging protocol.
- No source code changed.

**Errors faced**

| # | Symptom | Cause | Fix / workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| E0.1 | `node_modules` missing, so `exceljs` was unavailable | `npm install` has never been run in this checkout | Analysed the workbooks with a stdlib-only Python xlsx reader (in the session scratchpad, not the repo). **Run `npm install` at the start of Iteration 1.** |
| E0.2 | `ModuleNotFoundError: pandas` | Python 3.13 has no data libraries installed | Same stdlib reader (zipfile + ElementTree) |
| E0.3 | `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode '→'` | The Windows console defaults to cp1252. The oracle README contains `→` and `–`. | Run Python with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` |
| E0.4 | Monthly-summary dump over 57 KB, unreadable | Every cell carries a long `COUNTIFS` formula | Print cached values only and strip formula text |
| E0.5 | ripgrep rejected the glob `{a,b,src/**/*.{js,jsx}}` | Nested brace alternation is not supported | Use a flat glob such as `*.{js,jsx}` plus a path |

**Findings that change the design** (detail in §2):
- The real SLAs are rate-based and cross-file.
- The extracts are a multi-month snapshot.
- xlsx time-of-day is currently discarded.
- Two workflow files share one schema.

**Verification:** read-only analysis. Oracle totals are recorded in §2.3 for later comparison.

**Next:** confirm decisions D1–D5, then start Iteration 1 (Phases 1–3).

### Iteration 1 — 2026-09-24 · SLA engine built from the data

**Goal:** implement the Schedule 23 rules exactly as `SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx` defines them, and prove it against the workbook, before any UI work.

**Direction change (from the user):**
- Discard all demo logic and follow only `Claude_Data/`. Keep the UI design.
- Decisions D1–D7 are confirmed (§3).
- Work happens on the branch `feature/real-bancs-data`. Nothing is committed to `main`.

The plan was rewritten (§3) and §2.5 marked superseded, because the demo pipeline is being replaced rather than adapted.

**Changes**
- `npm install` (first run in this checkout).
- New config:
  - `config/sla-schedule.json`: SLAs, targets, cut-off, holidays, rule parameters
  - `config/mapping-23b.json`: generated
- New engine `server/engine/`:
  - `datetime.js`
  - `calendar.js`
  - `extracts.js`
  - `workflows.js`
  - `outcome.js`
  - `rules.js`
  - `engine.js`
  - `calendar.test.js`
- New scripts:
  - `scripts/extract-mapping.js`
  - `scripts/verify-real.js`
- `package.json`: added `test`, `verify:real`, `mapping:extract`.
- The old demo code is untouched so far. It is removed in Iteration 2 (B6).

**Errors faced**

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1.1 | `extract-mapping.js`: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')` | ExcelJS `row.values` is truncated after the last filled cell, so an empty *Dependency* column was `undefined` | Read the columns by index with `row.getCell(n)` |
| E1.2 | First verify run: 1,500 / 1,491 / 185 diffs on the 23B EBQ / 23C / 23E tabs | The harness compared informational columns (month, candidate workflow) on rows the oracle marks OUT OF SCOPE. The engine had no reason to produce them. The **Expected Result matched on every row.** | The harness compares only the scope verdict on OUT OF SCOPE rows |
| E1.3 | Monthly summary: every SLA read the wrong columns (a "vs Target" cell showed a Rate formula) | The group labels are merged over 6 columns and ExcelJS repeats the label on every merged cell. The last occurrence won. | Take the first occurrence of each label |
| E1.4 | Monthly summary: 190 diffs, "expected null" / NaN | **ExcelJS drops a formula's cached result when it is falsy** (`0` or `""`), leaving `{formula}` only | A formula cell without a result is read as 0 (counts) or blank (verdict) |
| E1.5 | `npm test` → `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` | `node --test server/engine/`: Node 24 treats a directory argument as a module path | Use the glob `node --test "server/**/*.test.js"` |

**Verification**
- `npm run verify:real` → **VERIFY PASSED**, for both the csv set and the xlsx set:
  - 23B EBQ (10,000 rows), 23A (1,207), 23B UL Step 2 (514), Step 3 (400), 23C (2,000), 23E (777): all 0 diffs
  - Monthly summary (22 months × 8 SLAs): 0 diffs
  - Run time: csv about 0.3 s, xlsx about 1 s
- Mutation check: setting `cutoffHour` to 14 and `maxHours` to 48.01 made the harness fail loudly. 23A showed 237 diffs, and exactly the five planted "48h00m00s" 23C cases flipped. The config was restored afterwards.
- `npm test` → 8/8 pass.
- The derived as-of date is 2026-09-24. All 231 open workflows agree on it.

**Next:** Iteration 2 (Phase B): swap the backend to the new engine, add the data-quality findings and API, auto-load on cold start, and delete the demo code.

### Iteration 2 — 2026-09-24 · Backend rebuilt on the extract set; demo code removed

**Goal:** Phase B. Serve everything from the new engine, derive data-quality findings from the data, rewrite intelligence / narrative / Q&A to use only computed figures, auto-load `Claude_Data/`, and delete the demo.

**Plan change:** Phase D's backend (D1–D2) moved into this iteration, because the old intelligence modules depended on the deleted demo engine. D3 (panel UI) joins the UI work in Iteration 3. Added C0 (strip the old per-month ingest UI).

**Changes**
- Engine:
  - `rules.js`: 23B returns the unmapped EBQ pairs. Step 2 and 23C record `candidateWorkflows`.
  - `engine.js`: returns `workflows`, `mappingRows` and `unmapped23B` for the findings.
  - The verify harness still reports 0 diffs.
- New:
  - `server/slots.js`: the 5 slots of an extract set. The workflow slot is open or closed, decided from the rows' Close Date.
  - `server/quality.js`: findings for the whole set and for each month.
  - `server/insights.js`: failure concentration.
  - `scripts/load-data.js` (`npm run data:load`).
  - `server/narrative.test.js`.
- Rewritten:
  - `server/store.js`: `data/extracts`, `data/analyses/<month>.json`, `data/snapshot.json`.
  - `server/pipeline.js`: `importExtracts`, where a newer file for the same slot supersedes the old one, so csv + xlsx of one extract cannot double-count. Also `rebuild` (one pack per month) and `loadBundled`.
  - `server/index.js`: the new API, with serialised writes and a cold-start auto-load.
  - `server/intelligence.js`: trends, pass/fail record, drivers, backlog. **No forecasts.**
  - `server/narrative.js`: new brief, rules text and prompt. It keeps the Bedrock client, cache and figure guard, and adds a **claims guard**.
  - `server/assistant.js`: resolves the 8 SLA lines.
  - `scripts/reset.js`.
- **Deleted** (demo):
  - `server/adapters/`, `classify.js`, `parse.js`, `slaEngine.js`, `dataQuality.js`, `prepareDemo.js`
  - `config/sla-metrics.json`, `config/source-templates.json`
  - `scripts/seed.js`, `scenario.js`, `generators/`, `lib/`, `prepare-demo.js`
  - `data/seed/`, `data/holdback/`
  - the npm scripts `seed` and `demo`
  - the dependencies `pdf-parse` and `pdfkit` (the data has no PDFs)
- Housekeeping:
  - `.gitignore`: all of `data/` is runtime state.
  - `.gitattributes`: dropped the seed rules.
  - `.env.example`: `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_DEMO` → `SKIP_BOOTSTRAP_DATA`.
  - `render.yaml` comment updated.

**Errors faced**

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| E2.1 | Node regex edits to `.gitignore` / `.gitattributes` / `.env.example` silently changed nothing | The working copies have **CRLF** line endings (git autocrlf), so `\n`-anchored patterns never matched | Edited with the Edit/Write tools. The same trap applies to any `\n` regex on tracked files. |
| E2.2 | The Bedrock (Nova Pro) narrative said **23C failed** in Aug 2026 (it passed, 96.97% vs 96%) and that **23B NUL fails most often** (23C does, 12 vs 11 months) | The figure guard only checks that numbers exist in the input. A real figure attached to the wrong claim passes it. The per-SLA `status` fields were easy to misread. | The brief now spells out `metTarget` / `missedTarget` lists and `missedTargetInMostCompleteMonths`. New `contradictedClaims()` guard rejects text that inverts a pass/fail or names the wrong "most often" SLA, and falls back to the rules text. Regression test uses the verbatim bad output. |
| E2.3 | Drivers listed groups at 1.01× the SLA's failure rate as "concentrations" | Ranking by failures × lift rewarded big groups at average rates | Require at least 1.25× the SLA rate. Rank by excess failures over the SLA rate. |
| E2.4 | Month findings listed "open past deadline" for 23B UL **and** its steps (double count) | The filter tested `x.parts` on result rows, which do not carry `parts` | Look up the roll-up ids in the schedule |
| E2.5 | A new narrative test failed | The test was wrong: "23B UL passed step 1 but failed overall" splits into a genuine pass claim, and rejecting it is the conservative behaviour | Rewrote the case to test real ambiguity |

**Verification**
- `npm run verify:real` → 0 diffs (csv + xlsx).
- `npm test` → 12/12.
- `npm run data:load` → 22 packs (2024-12 → 2026-09) in about 0.7 s. The totals equal the workbook's Total row for all 8 lines.
- API checks against the live server:
  - `bootstrap`: 22 months, 5 slots, 8 SLAs
  - `analysis/2026-08`: all 8 lines equal the workbook's Aug-2026 row
  - `items`: filters by SLA and outcome
  - `extracts`: 5/5 slots present
  - `intelligence`: backlog 1,399, which equals the sum of the workbook's overdue totals
  - `ask`: SLA resolution works, and off-topic questions are refused
- The Bedrock narrative after the fixes states every pass/fail correctly (checked by hand against the packs).

**Next:** Iteration 3 (Phase C + D3): move the UI onto the new API while keeping the visual design.

### Iteration 3 — 2026-09-24 · UI on the real data (design kept), README, end-to-end checks

**Goal:** Phase C + D3 + E. Move every screen onto the new API while keeping the visual design, rewrite the README, and prove the whole flow in a browser.

**Plan change:** Phase E (finish) was folded into this iteration. Iterations 4–5 are no longer needed.

**Changes**
- `src/App.jsx`: new routing.
  - `#dashboard` and `#extracts` (a global screen, because one extract set feeds every month)
  - `#<month>/position|exceptions|pack`
  - `/intel`
- New views and components:
  - `src/views/Extracts.jsx` (replaces Ingest): drop zone, 5-slot checklist, file rows, reload / rebuild, set findings
  - `src/views/Position.jsx` (replaces Consolidated): SLA table with the 23B UL steps nested, click-through to items, drivers, findings
  - `src/components/ItemTable.jsx`
- Rewritten on the new data (same design classes):
  - `Dashboard.jsx`: grouped by year, pass/fail cards, partial-month tag
  - `Exceptions.jsx`: failing SLAs plus every failed item, with filters
  - `Pack.jsx`: the print document
  - `Intelligence.jsx`: trend, SLA record, drivers, backlog, narrative, ask
  - `Rail.jsx`: Extracts nav, pass/fail period cards
  - `TrendChart.jsx`: rates vs target, fail region, clipped outliers
  - `NarrativeCard.jsx`: verdict from data, new topic labels
  - `AskReport.jsx`, `Chips.jsx` (`Status`, `Outcome`)
  - `lib/format.js`, `lib/sources.js`, `api.js`
- Deleted: `src/views/Ingest.jsx`, `src/views/Consolidated.jsx`, `src/components/ConfidenceRing.jsx`.
- `src/styles.css`: one small block added (nested SLA rows, filter bar, item table, nowrap chips). The existing tokens and classes are reused throughout.
- Server:
  - `intelligence.js` returns `allMonths` for the scope picker
  - `narrative.js` includes the completed-item count on the worst month
  - `extracts.js` reads **only the first worksheet** and rejects the expected-results workbook
  - new `server/engine/extracts.test.js`
- `README.md` rewritten for Schedule 23 on the BaNCS extracts.

**Errors faced**

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| E3.1 | A scripted edit of `NarrativeCard.jsx` failed ("missing: const TOPICS") | Regex literals such as `\b` inside a JS template string passed through a bash heredoc no longer matched the file text | Used the Edit tool for regex-bearing code |
| E3.2 | 23C trend chart flattened into a line along the top | December 2024 holds 1 completed 23C item (0%), which stretched the axis to 0–100% | Values more than 40 pp below target are drawn clipped at the axis with their real value labelled. "Weakest month" now shows its completed-item count. |
| E3.3 | The Service level record showed the latest month's PASS next to the whole-window rate (e.g. 23C 95.61% "PASS") | Mixed semantics in one cell | That cell now shows the window status |
| E3.4 | Narrative highlighting boxed "23" in "23C" and "24" in "24 September 2026" | The figure regex had no letter or date awareness | Lookbehind/lookahead on alphanumerics, plus skip rules for day-of-month and "Step N" |
| E3.5 | Tables overflowed the card at 1440 px: status chips wrapped, the outcome column was clipped | Too many columns and long labels | SLA name moved to a sub-line. Chips no longer wrap. Clock start → deadline share one cell. "Taken" folded into Completed. Outcome chips use short labels with the workbook term as tooltip. |
| E3.6 | **`SLA_Expected_Results.xlsx` was accepted as a WITHDRAWALEXT** and replaced the real one (found by the upload test) | The reader searched every sheet, and the workbook's '23B UL Step 2' tab carries every WITHDRAWALEXT column | Read only the first worksheet (BaNCS exports are single-sheet). Reject the workbook by its tabs. Regression tests cover every extract in both formats and the workbook. |

Note (branch): `git reflog` shows `checkout: moving from feature/real-bancs-data to Ommkar` at 15:00:38, just after the Iteration 1 commit. It did not come from Claude's commands. The Iteration 2 and 3 commits therefore landed on **`Ommkar`**, which now holds the whole initiative. `feature/real-bancs-data` stops at Iteration 1. `main` is untouched at `fcb17ec`. The branches were left as they are.

Note: the "exit code 127" notices for background servers were the servers stopped deliberately for restarts. They are not failures.

**Verification**
- `npx vite build` passes. Headless Edge screenshots were reviewed for Dashboard, Extracts, SLA position, Exceptions, Governance pack and Intelligence (Aug 2026). The August figures match the workbook line for line.
- Upload scenario through the API:
  - uploading the xlsx twins of EBQ and both WRKFLWEXT files replaced the csv copies with **unchanged totals**
  - the workbook was rejected with a clear message
  - removing WITHDRAWALEXT turned Step 2 to NO_DATA and raised a red "not supplied" finding
  - "Reload delivered extracts" restored the set
- Cold start: after `npm run reset`, a fresh server auto-loaded `Claude_Data/` and built 22 periods.
- `npm test` → 24/24. `npm run verify:real` → 0 diffs.
- The Bedrock narrative passes both guards, and every pass/fail it states is correct.

**Next:** user review in the browser (`npm run dev`). Nothing is on `main`. Merging or opening a PR is the user's call.

### Iteration 4 - 2026-10-01 - Original-data recovery and reporting-period audit

**Goal:** Answer the recovery question before extending September and adding October records.

**Changes**
- `docs/data-flow.md`: documented the original baseline, reload commands, targeted source restoration, snapshot replacement, and September/October completeness.
- `DEV_LOG.md`: added Phase F and this audit entry.
- `CLAUDE.md`: refreshed the working branch and recorded recovery/extension pitfalls.
- Source extracts, runtime data, engine code, and Git branches were not changed. The dataset choice is awaiting user input.

**Errors faced**

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| E4.1 | Initial Git commands reported no repository | Workspace root is one level above the repository | Ran Git commands from `AIB/` |
| E4.2 | Git warned that the global ignore file was inaccessible | Local filesystem permissions | Repository commands still succeeded; inspected the repository's own ignore rules |
| E4.3 | Inline Node audit failed with a syntax error | Windows command argument handling removed embedded quotes | Used the existing verification script and PowerShell JSON parsing |
| E4.4 | Listening-port lookup returned exit code 1 and no output | No matching listener was returned; errors were suppressed by the lookup | No server operation depended on the result; no server was changed |

**Verification**
- `npm run verify:real`: passed, zero row and monthly-summary differences for both CSV and XLSX sets, as of 2026-09-24.
- `git diff ba7fa6f -- Claude_Data`: no differences.
- Runtime snapshot: as of 2026-09-24, 17,869 source records and 12,254 measured items.
- Git audit: `Karthik` and `omkar/Ommkar` at `ba7fa6f`; local `main` and `backup-karthik` at `fcb17ec`, before BaNCS integration.

**Next:** Resolve the requested dataset type. Extend a separate demo copy if generated records are chosen, or import newer supplied extracts. Keep the original verification dataset intact.

### Iteration 5 - 2026-10-05 - End-to-end governance flow guide

**Goal:** Explain the complete file-to-frontend flow, including rule execution, calculation, storage, JSON boundaries and every governance feature shown in the presentation.

**Changes**
- `docs/end-to-end-governance-flow.md`: added a detailed plain-language architecture guide, sequence diagram, upload/parser/storage trace, actual 23B UL Step 2 worked example, rate and 23B pooling formulas, JSON boundary matrix, API/frontend mapping, governance-feature walkthrough and audit lineage.
- `DEV_LOG.md`: added completed Phase G and this iteration entry.
- `CLAUDE.md`: refreshed current status and recorded the verified JSON-boundary clarification.
- No engine, configuration, source extract or runtime data was changed.

**Errors faced**

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| E5.1 | The first combined inspection command ended with a Python `UnicodeEncodeError` while printing PowerPoint text | The Windows console used cp1252 and one slide contained a Unicode arrow | Re-ran the read-only extraction with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`; all presentation text was read successfully |
| E5.2 | Git again warned that the global ignore file was inaccessible | Local filesystem permissions outside the repository | No Git operation depended on it; repository status was still returned and no Git state was changed |

**Verification**
- Read all 17 slides of `AIB_Life_SLA_Governance_Presentation.pptx` and all 3 slides of `docs/AIB_Life_SLA_Governance_Project.pptx`; the guide covers the screens and flow shown there.
- Traced the documented functions in `server/index.js`, `pipeline.js`, `store.js`, `slots.js`, every `server/engine/*` stage, `quality.js`, `insights.js`, `intelligence.js`, `src/api.js`, `App.jsx` and all six views.
- Read an actual MISSED `23B_UL_S2` outcome from `data/analyses/2025-02.json` (policy `A90002283`, source row 213, workflow `7101283`) and used its stored evidence in the worked example.
- Documentation-only change; application tests were not required to validate executable behaviour.

**Next:** Use `docs/end-to-end-governance-flow.md` as the walkthrough companion for the existing presentation and live demonstration.
